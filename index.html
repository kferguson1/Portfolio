                <p> Welcome! My name is Kiara Ferguson. I am a 27 year old aspiring Software Engineer living in the Richmond, VA area. I am currently a MSIT candidate at North Carolina Agricultural and State University with an expected graduation date of May 2021. In addition, I am working to complete a Coding Bootcamp through Virginia’s University of Richmond with an expected completion date of May 2021. </p>
               <p> Kiara first started showing interest in coding back in the good old days of MySpace. Sneaking to make accounts in middle school just to decorate the pages, at the time, unaware that this could be made into a career. After her myspace days were over she did not come back to coding until around age 22 when she decided to launch her own blog. Countless nights of YouTube videos and Wordpress articles and seven months later she had her website all ready to go. However, she wasn’t quite pleased with it. Although it didn’t look quite how she wanted and the process was challenging she realized she actually loved the process of trying to develop a website on the front end. There she began her journey of looking into the wonderful world of code. </p>
